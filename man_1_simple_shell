.SH NAME
.B simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./simple_shell
.P
.B [command] [arguments]
.P
.B ./shell [script_file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell is a minimalist UNIX command language interpreter capable of executing
commands both interactively from \fBSTDIN\fR and non-interactively from files or pipes.

Invocation
.P
When invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by
.BR isatty (3)),
the shell runs in interactive mode, displaying a prompt ("$ ") and waiting for user input.
.P
When invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, the shell reads and executes commands line by line until EOF.
.P
If a file argument is provided, the shell reads and executes commands from that file, one per line, before exiting.

Environment
.P
Upon startup, \fBsimple_shell\fR inherits the environment of its parent process. The environment is an array of \fBNAME=VALUE\fR pairs representing variables.

Command Execution
.P
After tokenizing a command line, the shell follows these rules:
.IP 1. 4
If the command matches a builtin, that builtin is executed.
.IP 2. 4
Otherwise, the shell searches the directories listed in the \fBPATH\fR variable for an executable file matching the command.
.IP 3. 4
If the command is specified with an absolute or relative path, the shell attempts to execute it directly.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell exits with the status of the last executed command.  
Zero indicates success; non-zero indicates failure.  
Builtins return zero on success and non-zero on errors.

.SH SIGNALS
While in interactive mode:
.P
.IP \(bu 4
\fBSIGINT\fR (Ctrl+C) is ignored by the shell but interrupts running child processes.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBEOF\fR (Ctrl+D) exits the shell gracefully.

.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
.TP
.BR exit
Exit the shell.
.TP
.BR env
Display the current environment variables.
.TP
.BR setenv " " [name] " " [value]
Set or update an environment variable.
.TP
.BR unsetenv " " [name]
Remove an environment variable.
.TP
.BR cd " " [directory]
Change the current working directory.

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive:
.P
.EX
$ ./shell
$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 user user   123 main.c
-rw-r--r--  1 user user   456 shell.c
$ exit
.EE
.P
Non-interactive:
.P
.EX
$ echo "ls -l" | ./shell
$ cat script.sh | ./shell
.EE

.SH SYSTEM CALLS
The implementation relies on:
.BR execve (2),
.BR fork (2),
.BR wait (2),
.BR perror (3),
.BR malloc (3),
.BR free (3),
.BR access (2),
.BR signal (2),
and related system calls.

.SH BUGS
This is a learning project; error handling may not cover all edge cases.
